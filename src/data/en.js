                        My name is <strong>Thomas Horv√°th</strong>, originally a musician, composer, creator. 
                        I started to deal more seriously with web development in 2022.`,
        secundParagraph: `
                        I like creating, learning is my hobby. I like logical systems. To solve tasks 
                        precisely, striving for perfection, but also creatively.`,
        thirdParagraph: `
                        <strong>In the spring of 2022</strong>, I was given the opportunity to gain insight
                        into the world of IT as part of the "Redesign" program. During the <strong>system 
                        operator</strong> training, I mastered computer technology principles, the basics of 
                        network operation, and the construction, use and operation of client (Windows, Linux)
                        and server-side (Windows Server, Linux Server) operating systems, virtual machines 
                        (Hyper-V, Docker) and cloud platforms (Azure, AWS).`,
        forthParagraph: `
                        After that, I took part in <strong>database specialist</strong> training, where I 
                        learned the SQL language at an advanced level, as well as the use, configuration and 
                        operation of various database software (MS SQL, MySQL, MongoDB). In addition, 
                        I also mastered the design and optimization of databases.`,
        fifthParagraph: `
                        Due to my commitment to continuous learning, and because I always like to see the big
                        picture, I set my sights on <strong>full-stack development</strong> career. In addition to mastering
                        <strong>front-end development</strong>  at an advanced level, my current goal is to learn about the back-end
                        side, with which I will be able to implement complete systems on the web development
                        platform.`,
